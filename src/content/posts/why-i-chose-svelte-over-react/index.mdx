<TextBlock>
  You may have noticed for my MoneyKit project I've chosen to use SvelteKit as
  the front-end framework rather than React/Next.js. This was a conscious
  choice, and not just because it had Kit in the name. Here are some reasons why
  I chose Svelte over React:
</TextBlock>

<HeadingBlock>Hype</HeadingBlock>
<TextBlock>
  Svelte was on my radar because of the praise it received online & in surveys
  like State of JavaScript & Stack Overflow surveys. Developers that had used it
  touted the speed, simplicity & ease of use. I had also watched a few talks
  from Svelte creator Rich Harris & was impressed by his vision for the
  framework.
</TextBlock>

<HeadingBlock>Less Code</HeadingBlock>
<TextBlock>
  After using .NET to build an app for my Masters degree I haven't really
  touched it since. Modern .NET (dotnet?) receives a lot of praise online but
  I've found the verbosity of C# a bit clunky compared to something like
  TypeScript. In regards to MVC style web frameworks I found Django's simplicity
  and nice built-ins as a worthy trade-off for .NET's type-safety and raw speed.
  Despite this, the reality is most Australian software positions are .NET so it
  can't help to do a refresh & see what all the fuss is about.
</TextBlock>

<HeadingBlock>Built in Global State</HeadingBlock>
<TextBlock>
  With Svelte you don't need to add global state libraries like Redux or
  Zustand. Svelte provides the ability to extract global state into svelte.ts
  files. Combined with Svelte's Context API (which is much simpler than React's)
  you can easily lift state up & use import where necessary.
