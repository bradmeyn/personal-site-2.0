<TextBlock>
  As part of redesigning my site & moving to Astro I wanted to test the MDX
  features with a blog, however I wasn't sure what to write about. Ultimately I
  have decided to come up with some software-based resolutions for the new year.

<HeadingBlock>Sample more .NET</HeadingBlock>
<TextBlock>
  After using .NET to build an app for my Masters degree I haven't really
  touched it since. I didn't hate it, howerver did find the verbosity of C# &
  OOP a bit clunky compared to something like TypeScript w/Node. Despite my
  reservations, modern .NET does receive a lot of praise on Reddit and I do see
  the appeal of not having to glue a bunch of services together or sacrifice
  type-safety or raw speed like you do with Django.

<HeadingBlock>Build a AWS-based project</HeadingBlock>
<TextBlock>
  Despite having an basic AWS certification, thanks to the various free saas
  wrappers around AWS I haven't had much need to use it directly. I'm hoping to
  change this in 2025, coming up with something where I can incorporate a range
  of AWS products & rack up a huge bill.
