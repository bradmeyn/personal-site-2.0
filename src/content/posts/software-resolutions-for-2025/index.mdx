<TextBlock>
  As part of redesigning my site & moving to Astro I wanted to test the MDX
  features with a blog, however I wasn't sure what to write about. Ultimately I
  have decided to come up with some software-based resolutions for the new year.

<HeadingBlock>Sample more .NET</HeadingBlock>
<TextBlock>
  After using .NET to build an app for my Masters degree I haven't really
  touched it since. Modern .NET (dotnet?) receives a lot of praise online but
  I've found the verbosity of C# a bit clunky compared to something like
  TypeScript. In regards to MVC style web frameworks I found Django's simplicity
  and nice built-ins as a worthy trade-off for .NET's type-safety and raw speed.
  Despite this, the reality is most Australian software positions are .NET so it
  can't help to do a refresh & see what all the fuss is about.

<HeadingBlock>Turn MoneyKit into Money</HeadingBlock>
<TextBlock>
  I've been playing around with my financial calculators app for a while (I
  obsess over design way too much) and I'd like to actually do something with
  it, even if it's just buy a proper domain & try to get some ad revenue.
</TextBlock>

<HeadingBlock>Build a AWS-based project</HeadingBlock>
<TextBlock>
  Despite having an basic AWS certification, thanks to the various free saas
  wrappers around AWS I haven't had much need to use it directly. I'm hoping to
  change this in 2025, coming up with something where I can incorporate a range
  of AWS products & rack up a huge bill.
