<TextBlock>
  As part of redesigning my site & moving to Astro I wanted to test the MDX
  features with a blog, however I wasn't sure what to write about. Ultimately I
  have decided to come up with some software-based resolutions for the new year.

<HeadingBlock>Sample more .NET</HeadingBlock>
<TextBlock>
  After using .NET to build an app for my Masters degree I haven't really
  touched it since. I didn't hate it, however the verbosity of C# & OOP always
  seemed cumbersome to me relative to TypeScript. Despite this I know that it is highly used and regarded in the industry, and after reading <LinkBlock href="https://typescript-is-like-csharp.chrlschn.dev/" title="TypeScript is like C#"/> I would like to try it out some more.For a while I've wanted to explore building a
CRM-style project that incorporate the best practices of React and connecting
with a .NET backend makes a lot of sense, especially if there is an easy way
to generate TypeScript types.

<HeadingBlock>Build a AWS-based project</HeadingBlock>
<TextBlock>
  Despite having an basic AWS certification, thanks to the various free saas
  wrappers around AWS I haven't had much need to use it directly. I'm hoping to
  change this in 2026, coming up with something where I can incorporate a range
  of AWS products & rack up a huge bill.
