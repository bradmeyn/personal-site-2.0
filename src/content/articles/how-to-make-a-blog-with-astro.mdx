Astro collections are a powerful way to manage your content. In this article, we will explore how to define and use collections in Astro.

#

## What are Collections?

Collections in Astro allow you to group related content together. This can be useful for organizing articles, blog posts, or any other type of content.

#

## Defining a Collection

To define a collection in Astro, you typically create a directory in the `src/content` folder and add your content files there. Here's an example of how you might structure your project:

#

<CodeBlock
  language="plaintext"
  code={`
src/
└── content/
    └── blog/
        ├── post1.md
        ├── post2.md
        └── post3.md
  `}
/>

## Using Collections in Code

Here's a simple example of how you might query and use a collection in an Astro component:

#

<CodeBlock
  language="astro"
  code={`
---
import { getCollection } from 'astro:content';

## const allBlogPosts = await getCollection('blog');

---

<ul>
  {allBlogPosts.map((post) => (
    <li>
      <a href={"/blog/" + post.slug}>{post.data.title}</a>
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>
`} />

This code fetches all entries from the 'blog' collection and renders them as a list of links.
